## Features

* **Customizable:** You don't need to be an expert to customize AdminKit. Our code is very readable and well documented.
* **Fully Responsive:** With mobile, tablet & desktop support it doesn't matter what device you're using. AdminKit is responsive in all browsers.
* **Cross-Browser:** Our themes are working perfectly with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge. We're working hard to support them.
* **Clean Code:** We strictly follow Bootstrap's guidelines to make your integration as easy as possible. All code is handwritten.
* **No jQuery:** AdminKit, and all third-party libraries used in the admin template, do not require jQuery as a dependency.
* **Regular Updates:** From time to time you'll receive an update containing new components, improvements, and bugfixes.

## Quick start


### Build tools

The theme includes a custom Webpack file, which can be used to quickly recompile and minify theme assets while developing or for deployment. You'll need to install Node.js before using Webpack.

Once Node.js is installed, run npm install to install the rest of AdminKit's dependencies. All dependencies will be downloaded to the node_modules directory.

```sh
npm install
```

Now you're ready to modify the source files and generate new dist/ files. AdminKit uses webpack-dev-server to automatically detect file changes and start a local webserver at http://localhost:8080.

```sh
npm start
```

Compile, optimize, minify and uglify all source files to dist/ folder:

```sh
npm run build
```
